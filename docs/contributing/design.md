# Designing VueTube Interfaces

We welcome all front end designers to contribute to the VueTube project. If you're interested in designing interfaces
for the VueTube project, please read the following guidelines.

## General Guidelines

* It is highly recommended that you join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/7P8KJrdd5W) to discuss & coordinate
  your
  ideas with us. This is to ensure that your designs can be best implemented into the app and that we are able to
  contact
  you for further information or discussion.


* For the most part, we will be using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to design our interfaces. If you are not familiar
  with Figma, we recommend that you read
  their [documentation](https://help.figma.com) to familiarize yourself
  with the tool.


* Most of our designs are based on the [Material Design](https://material.io/design) guidelines. However, at times we
  may
  deviate from these guidelines to better suit our needs.


* Please open an issue on the repository you are working on to discuss your design ideas with us before you start
  designing. This is so that we are able to provide feedback and prevent you from wasting time on designs that may not
  be
  implemented.

## Find an Issue to Work On

We understand that GitHub's issue tracker can be overwhelming at times, especially since it wasn't designed with
designers in mind. If you are having trouble finding an issue to work on, we recommend that you filter by
the `designers wanted` label. This label is used to indicate that we are looking for designers to help us design
interfaces for the app.

## Git for Designers

::: tip
Note: You may not need to use Git if you are only designing interfaces. However, if you are interested in contributing
to this project's codebase or any other project in the future, you will need to learn how to use Git.
:::
If you are not familiar with Git, we recommend that you read [this guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) for
a detailed explanation of how Git works. If you are familiar with Git, but are not familiar with GitHub, we recommend
that you read [this guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) for a detailed explanation of how GitHub
works.

If you are not familiar or comfortable with command line tools, we recommend that you
use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) to manage your Git
repositories.

## Submitting Your Designs

::: tip
If you are unfamiliar with GitHub Issues, we recommend that you
read [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/)
or [the quickstart guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart) to familiarize
yourself with the issue tracker.
:::

Once you have finished designing your interfaces, you can submit your designs by opening an issue on the repository
using the `design subbmission` template. Our
maintainers will review your designs and provide feedback. If your designs are approved, we will add
the `design approved` label to your issue. If your designs are not approved, we will add the `design rejected` label to
your issue and provide feedback on why your designs were rejected.

Alternatively, if you wish to start an open discussion about your designs, you may want to use the discussions tab on
the GitHub repository.

We highly recommend that you include a link to your [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) file in your issue. This will allow us to easily review your
designs as well as provide feedback.
