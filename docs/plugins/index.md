# Creating Plugins

## The Basics

### What is a VueTube plugin?
A VueTube plugin is a third party addon for VueTube that anyone can make!

### What are the benefits?
To install VueTube plugins, all you need to do is add the javascript file to `/VueTube/plugins` on your device. This is perfect for redistributing your code for people who don't want to recompile the whole app. It's also an easier developing environment for you, the developer, so that you don't have to understand ALL of our code to make changes.

### Are there any drawbacks?
Currently the VueTube plugin framework is still under heavy development and some features may be unavailable that you could accomplish with an app recompile. We will be working on the plugin framework as time progresses. We are open to suggestions!
