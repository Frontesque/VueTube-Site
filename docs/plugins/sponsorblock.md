## What is SponsorBlock?
SponsorBlock is a crowdsourced third-party open source extension and API that automatically skips annoying segments in YouTube videos, such as **paid sponsors**, **interaction reminders** (e.g. "Subscribe to my channel"), **recap of previous videos** and **non-music parts** in music videos. It even has an option to directly go to the most important part of a video (Highlighted segment). You can customize which types of segments you want to be skipped and which you want to watch. This is integrated in **VueTube** as a plugin.

*Fun fact: SponsorBlock has saved more than 612 years of people's time with more than 500 million skips.*

## How does it work?
Users can submit segments in videos which are sent to the SponsorBlock database using a privacy preserving query system. The extension fetch segments of a video when you open it and skips them. You can also upvote or downvote another user's segments, so SponsorBlock recognizes which segments are incorrect and ignores them. You can read more about how it works through the [About page](https://sponsor.ajay.app/about).
